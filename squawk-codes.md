# Squawk codes
### Aircraft transponder codes

The term squawk as you may correctly assume, is connected to the birds talk. It all started during the II World War, when the Allies had to figure out which of the aircraft flying over Great Britain were friendly and which were Luftwaffe planes “hiding” among the Allied planes heading back from a mission. The radars back then could only tell that something is approaching from a given direction, but they couldn’t figure out who that was. That’s was a secondary radar was developed, which could identify friend and enemy aircraft by sending signals and receiving (or not) identification codes in response. If the plane could send back a proper signal, it was identified as friend. This system was called Identification Friend or Foe (or IFF in short) by the US and had a British codename Parrot. Now it should be clearer: parrot – squawking – squawk codes. You get the point.

Squawk codes are four-digit octal numbers, which means that each digit can be from 0 to 7. That gives us a total of 4096 combinations. In standard situations, the pilots have to apply the squawk code assigned for the flight by air traffic control and keep the transponder on during the whole flight, until they land and exit the runway. But there are a few that are more important that the others – the emergency codes defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). They are set on the planes transponder when something goes wrong and ground control should be notified. To each of the emergency squawk codes, there is a simple rule which helps to remember what they mean:

|Emergency Code | Meaning | How to remember |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
|7500 | Aircraft hijacking | seven-five - man with knife|
|7600 | Radio failure | seven-six - radio fix|
|7700	| Emergency | seven-seven - go to heaven|

Of course a 7700 doesn’t always have to be set for life-threatening problems, some pilots set this code just to let air traffic control know that something is not right and they are working on it.

Modern radars require more information from the aircraft than just its squawk code. The currently used Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) system for example gives the ground control the information on the current location, altitude, and velocity of the plane. 

If you want to see the squawk codes of the currently flying aircraft, check the [ADS-B Exchange website](https://globe.adsbexchange.com), which shows the data in the specific machine information, as well as in the visible aircraft list (you can enable the “Squawk” column in the view).
