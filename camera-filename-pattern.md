# Camera filename patterns

#OSINT / #IMINT hint: you can determine the probable camera maker by the photo's filename:
* CIMGXXXX - Casio
* CSC_XXXX - Nikon camera (photo was edited with camera)
* DSC_XXXX - Nikon (digital still camera - sRGB color space) / Sony smartphone
* _DSCXXXX - Nikon (AdobeRGB color space)
* DSCXXXXX - Sony camera / SonyEricsson phone
* DSCFXXXX - Fuji
* DSCNXXXX - Nikon
* DUW - mobile phones
* HPIMXXXX - HP
* IMG_XXXX - Canon
* IMG_XXXX (usually jpg or heic) - iPhone
* IMGPXXXX - Pentax
* KIF_XXXX - Kyocera
* MGP_XXXX - Pentax
* P101XXXX - Olympus / Panasonic (the 101 is an MDD format date, up to c31, where month is in HEX from 1 to c, and days are from 01 to 31)
* PICTXXXX - Minolta
* PXL_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSSTTT â€“ Google Pixel (Android 11, time in UTC)
* RSC_XXXX - Nikon (reflex still camera?)
* SAM_XXXX - Samsung
* SANYXXXX - Sanyo
* SDCXXXXX - Samsung
* SVI_XXXX - Sound Vision

where X is a decimal.

Of course the filename can be very easily altered so don't be 100% sure of the outcome (as regarding every OSINT clue).
